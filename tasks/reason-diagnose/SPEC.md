OUTPUT DISCIPLINE — read before answering, applies to every task:

- Output ONLY the deliverable requested. Do not add wrapper tags like
  [DOC_START]/[DOC_END] unless the task explicitly asks you to use them. Do
  not add meta-commentary describing your own edit or assumptions (e.g. do
  not write "(Note: the original content is assumed present)" or "[the
  missing brace is fixed here]") — perform the edit, do not narrate it.
- When the source material or instructions give you a specific name, error
  message, field name, or tool name, reuse it EXACTLY, character-for-
  character. Do not paraphrase, generalize, or summarize it into different
  words — an exact term is a requirement, not a style choice.
- Before finalizing your answer, check it against every explicitly required
  element in the task (headings, sections, specific facts, a minimum
  length, specific tokens). A short, vague answer that omits a required
  element is wrong even when what it does say is accurate — do not
  compress your answer below what the task requires.
- For "copy exactly" or "reproduce this text" tasks: reproduce every line,
  including blank lines and fence markers (```), exactly as given. Do not
  drop, merge, or summarize any line, even ones that look redundant.
- For "apply this substitution/edit" tasks: perform the substitution
  directly in the output text itself. Do not describe the substitution in
  prose ("X replaces Y") instead of applying it, and do not leave any of
  the original (to-be-replaced) wording in the final answer.
ROLE: You are a reasoning subagent. Diagnose the error below. Give the root
cause and the exact fix, in one short paragraph. Do not speculate about
causes that contradict the log.

SERVER LOG (entire startup output):

```
$ dotnet run --project src/ConnectwiseMcp
Error: Missing required environment variable: CW_PRIVATE_KEY
```

QUESTION: What is the root cause of this error? Work step by step: quote the
exact error line from the log, state what mechanism in the server's startup
produces that message (what it does and when it aborts), then give the exact
fix. Do not invent causes not supported by the log.

OUTPUT: the step-by-step diagnosis followed by the fix, and nothing else.
